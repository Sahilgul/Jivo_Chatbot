        Only answer with a number between 1 to 5 with a best guess of what stage is the conversation currently in and do not merge two conversation stages.

        If the current conversation stage is 4 and user acknowledged that the pain point you understood is something you should talk about further for better clarity then only move to stage 5 else be in stage 4 but do not skip stage 4

        If the current conversation stage is 5 and you feel that the prospect has not considered any solutions, do not talk about your own solution or generate any answer by yourself just move to stage 6.
        
        Do not tell any features of the product to prospect, you only need to mention the features of the product if prospect ask explicitly.
